                                     OVERVIEW SECTION
     ========================================================================================= -->
## Overview

Distributed Computing (CSC802) and Distributed Computing Lab (CSL802) are core subjects in the Final Year (Semester VIII) of the Computer Engineering curriculum at the University of Mumbai. These courses provide foundational knowledge of distributed systems, middleware technologies, and coordination algorithms.

### Course Topics

The curriculum encompasses several key domains in Distributed Computing (DC):

- **Distributed System Models**: Architecture patterns, client-server models, and peer-to-peer systems.
- **Communication Paradigms**: Remote Procedure Calls (RPC), Remote Method Invocation (RMI), and Message-oriented communication.
- **Synchronization**: Physical and Logical clocks (Lamport, Vector), and Global State collection.
- **Election and Mutual Exclusion**: Bully algorithm, Ring algorithm, and distributed locking mechanisms.
- **Consistency and Replication**: Data-centric and Client-centric consistency models, and replication protocols.
- **Distributed File Systems**: Architecture, naming, and caching in systems like NFS and GFS.

### Repository Purpose

This repository represents a curated collection of study materials, reference books, lab experiments, and personal preparation notes compiled during my academic journey. The primary motivation for creating and maintaining this archive is simple yet profound: **to preserve knowledge for continuous learning and future reference.**

As a computer engineer, understanding distributed computing is crucial for developing modern, scalable applications. This repository serves as my intellectual reference point: a resource I can return to for relearning concepts, reviewing methodologies, and strengthening understanding when needed.

**Why this repository exists:**

- **Knowledge Preservation**: To maintain organized access to comprehensive study materials beyond the classroom.
- **Continuous Learning**: To support lifelong learning by enabling easy revisitation of fundamental concepts.
- **Academic Documentation**: To authentically document my learning journey through Distributed Computing.
- **Community Contribution**: To share these resources with students and learners who may benefit from them.

All materials in this repository were gathered, organized, and documented by me during my undergraduate studies (2018-2022) as part of my coursework and exam preparation.

</div>

> [!TIP]
> **Implementation Note**: This laboratory utilizes **Python** and **Java** for core implementations. Most experiments involve network simulations; ensure your environment allows communication over local sockets. Using **Pyro4** for RMI experiments and **Socket** programming for low-level communication is essential.

### Acknowledgments

Grateful acknowledgment to [**Mega Satish**](https://github.com/msatmod) for her exceptional contribution to this repository through "The Wall" - comprehensive module-wise notes that became an invaluable resource for understanding complex Distributed Computing concepts. Her constant support, patience, and clarity throughout this journey made a real difference. Learning alongside her was transformative, not only because she explained concepts so clearly, but because she truly cared about understanding them together. Her thoughtful approach to teaching, openness to discussion, and steady encouragement turned challenges into meaningful learning moments. This work reflects the growth that came from learning side by side. Thank you, Mega, for everything you shared and taught along the way.

Grateful acknowledgment to [**Mega Satish**](https://github.com/msatmod) and [**Hasan Rizvi**](https://github.com/rizvihasan) for their exceptional support, collaborative efforts, and the technical insights they shared during the development of the "A Comparative Study on Distributed File Systems" project. Working alongside them was a truly enriching experience - their technical expertise, dedication to exploring distributed architectures, and enthusiasm for innovation turned every challenge into a meaningful learning opportunity. Our shared curiosity and collaborative efforts in analyzing complex distributed storage solutions were essential to the project's success. Thank you, Mega and Hasan, for being such outstanding project partners and for all the knowledge and encouragement you shared along the way.

Grateful acknowledgment to the faculty members of the Department of Computer Engineering at Terna Engineering College for their guidance in Distributed Computing. Their clear teaching and continued support helped develop a strong understanding of distributed systems and coordination paradigms.
